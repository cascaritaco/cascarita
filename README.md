# Cascarita

Welcome to Cascarita! This file provides instructions on how to run important commands and navigate through the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [brew](https://brew.sh/) - Make sure brew is installed

### Installation

1. Install Node

```bash
brew install node
```

2. Setup the MySQL database

```bash
# install and activate mysql service
brew install mysql
brew services start mysql

# This will log you into SQL CLI (ie. mysql>)
mysql -u root

# Lastly create the following database
CREATE DATABASE test_db;
```

3. Setup the MongoDB database

```bash
# Download the official Homebrew formula for MongoDB
brew tap mongodb/brew
# Install MongoDB
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
# Start the MongoDB service
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

4. Clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cascaritaco/cascarita.git
```

5. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd cascarita
```

6. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

7. Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

8. Once your cluster is created, get your connection string to extract the username, password, url, and app name.

```txt
mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@$URL/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=$APPNAME
```

9. Copy `.env.example` into a new file named `.env`. Populate the `MONGO_*` environment variables from `.env` with the data extracted from the connection string.

```bash
# MongoDB cluster configuration
MONGO_CLUSTER_USERNAME=
MONGO_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=
MONGO_CLUSTER_DB_NAME=
MONGO_CLUSTER_URL=
MONGO_CLUSTER_APP_NAME=
```

10. If your MySQL database requires a password, make sure you set that password in the `.env` as well.

```bash
DB_NAME=test_db
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Using Docker

If you haven't done so, please download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), and start the Docker daemon, then run:

```bash
# load the environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# build the images
docker-compose build
# start the client and server container
docker-compose up
```

**NOTE**: It's important to ensure that for local connections to database from the server container, specify within the `.env` `DB_HOST=host.docker.internal`. This will be the way we are planning on deploying our applicaton to the cloud!

#### 1. Start the Development Server

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
# load the environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# runs react frontend on port 3000 and backend node server on port 3001
npm run dev
```

**NOTE**: In order for this to work you will need to ensure that `.env` `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`.

#### 2. Start the Production Server

To run the project as in production:

```bash
# load the environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# builds the `dist` directory used to serve frontend
npm run build
# starts the node server
npm run start
```

#### 3. Running Tests

To run the Jest tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

#### 4. Running Coverage

To see total testing coverage:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

#### 5. Running ESlint

To identify and fixing problems in our code:

```bash
npm run eslint
```

#### 6. Running DB Migrations

To run any Sequalize migrations:

```bash
npm run sequelize:migrate
```
